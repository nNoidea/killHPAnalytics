# killHPAnalytics

The powershell script `killHPAnalytics.ps1` stops and disables the following services:

```
HPAppHelperCap,
HPDiagsCap,
HpTouchpointAnalyticsService,
HPNetworkCap,
HPOmenCap,
HPSysInfoCap
```

The bat script is for running the powershell script in admin mode, since running a bat file in admin is very easy on windows.
